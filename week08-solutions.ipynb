    "In this Practical you will implement different architectures of neural networks for solving the sentiment analysis task. Last week you applied Multilayer Perceptron with average embedding vectors passed as input to perform the same task. This time you will used the Embedding layer available in Keras. Instead of a single (averaged) embedding vector, the model will take a sequence of embeddings as input. You will explore the following network architectures:\n",
    "1. Multilayer Perceptron with the Embedding layer, which allows to learn an embedding for each word in the training set along with the neural network learning process.\n",
    "2. Multilayer Perceptron with the Embedding layer and custom pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "3. Convolutional Neural Network with the pre-trained word embeddings."
